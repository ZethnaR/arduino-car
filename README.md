UPDATE 29/11/2025

I managed to built the car in a week and the code does work on it. But there's only one little tiny problem with the car: The DC Motors were to weak for its weight.

For context, the car was built with different components than the ones that comes in a kit. The meaning of it was because they want me to create a robotic kit for a car and I didn't have the resources, the knowledge or the time to do it, so I ended up building the car with stuff I found in my workplace. Those components were:

- 2x Protoboards (I guess that's the name, I'm not talking about breadboards.)
- 2x DC Motors (Normal DC Motors)
- 4x bottle caps (the plastic ones.)
- 1x Ultrasonic Sensor
- 1x L293B Motor Driver
- 1x Arduino NANO

I improvised the caster wheel with a spoon, btw.

I'll be uploading some images of the car (I call it Lil' McQueen) and some videos about its functionality in several days, but lemme tell a spoiler: I wrecked the car in a attempt of build a more lightly car, but I couldn't finish that one.

Oh well, I'll be working on it during this month.
